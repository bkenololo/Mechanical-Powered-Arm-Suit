# Arm Exoskeleton (Power-Assist Wearable)

A wearable arm exoskeleton designed to **amplify human arm strength** using a muscle-inspired mechanism. This project explores mechanical design, power systems, and human-robot interaction for enhanced movement assistance.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Provide **power augmentation** for lifting/repetitive tasks.
- Mimic natural arm mechanics for ergonomic movement.
- Modular design for future upgrades (sensors, AI control).
