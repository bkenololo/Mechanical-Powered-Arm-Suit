# Mechanical Powered Arm Suit
 An arm exoskeleton with power source to give more movement power

A project to build an wearable arm exoskeleton with human muscle-approach mechanism. This arm exoskeleton provides "power amplification" so that the arm can give more power in total.

I don't use a motor/actuator directly on the joint, instead I try to mimic the human muscle by using a high-tension high-durability cables to pull the lower arm from different direction thus we can mimic the human muscle mechanism. The cables are connected to some motor/actuator someplace else, this is good because it means less mass on the joint, which means more agility for movements.

I've made two versions of the lo-fi prototype. I've made two code versions as well, the first version controls servo with keys, while the second version controls servo with trackpad. I made these protoypes in macOS, slight differences in the code are expected.
